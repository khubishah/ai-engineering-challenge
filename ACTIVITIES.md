##### üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested: The language is simple and sounds like something that would make sense to a child. The formatting is much better now, so I feel like a great variety in headers and fonts could be used.
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested: It did the job of summarizing the paragraph well by grabbing all the key points on a paragraph about the joy of making pizza. I realized I couldn't hit return to create new lines in my message. The response that came back also did not have formatting for a list with newline characters.
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: The response was within the word count limit, and the story was quite well-written and creative. The formatting was nice with emojis and variety in boldness and style to convey the meaning of the story.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: The logic was much more organized and formatted. Though mathematical expression were not properly converted into a readable format. Also there was not wrap-around for when the user input becomes too long, resulting in the user not being able to see the earliest parts of the chat message.
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested: It did a great job at converting a casual paragraph that I wrote to my friend about octopus fun facts into a very professional paragraph. It covers all the original content, but conveyed it in a much more professional tone with formal language.
