Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested: The language is simple and sounds like something that would make sense to a child. The formatting now includes paragraphs, sections, bullets, emojis, and in general a much more chat-gpt-like feel.
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested: It did the job of summarizing the paragraph well by grabbing all the key points on a paragraph about the joy of making pizza. I realized I couldn't hit return to create new lines in my message. This time, there was bullets and bolded words.
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: The response was within the word count limit, and the story was quite well-written and creative. The assistant threw in some extra emojis.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: The logic was correct, and the reasoning was explained well. There was a use of words and mathematical expressions to describe the problem, break it down into intermediate steps, and provide a final answer. The math was all correct too, but this time, with visuals of oranges and apples to accompany the explanation.
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    - Aspect Tested: It did a great job at converting a casual paragraph that I wrote to my friend about octopus fun facts into a very professional paragraph. It covers all the original content, but conveyed it in a much more professional tone with formal language.

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
You can't check edge cases super easily, it's highly manual which makes it hard to scale, and human evaluation can be subjective.
